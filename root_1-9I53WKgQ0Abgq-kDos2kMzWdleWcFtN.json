Such was the duel fought by Shankar and Thakur Bhavani Singh, with the latter emerging as the victor. Years later, Bhavani's son, Prithvi, returns from London, meets Shankar's son, Gora and daughter, Tara, befriends them, and eventually both Tara and Prithvi fall in love with each other. When Bhavani finds this out, he wants Prithvi to marry Rajeshwari, who comes from a rich family, and will destroy Gora Shankar and his tribe of gypsies. Unable to make up his mind, Prithvi ends up marrying both women, leading to Tara giving birth to a son, Pratap.
