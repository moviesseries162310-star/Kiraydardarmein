    "description": "The Club was a British reality television show, broadcast weekly on ITV. It ran for six weeks, beginning on Thursday 6 March 2003. Presented by Donna Air and Matt Brown, three celebrities were given control of their own individual bar in a London club, named Nylon. Each celebrity was given their own changeable team of staff and viewers were given the chance to vote the celebrities' staff off the show. At the end of the series, viewers were asked to vote for their favourite celebrity bar manager. Actor Dean Gaffney was the eventual winner, beating presenter/singer Richard Blackwood and former page three model, Samantha Fox. 49 percent of the audience voted him the best manager and he won the £15,000 prize. An ITV2 spin-off show also aired for the duration, and a highlights show aired on Saturday nights on ITV. Dooley's Vodka Toffee sponsored the show.",
